Your friend is an experienced coder who just started learning Python. Since she is already 
proficienct in Java and C++, she decided to write all of her snippets in all three languages,
in order to ensure the Python code was working as expected. Here's a very first function your
friend wrote in Python and Java (the C++ version is the same as Java one):

Python:
def division(x, y):
  return x // y
  
Java:
int division(int x, int y) {
  return x / y;
  }

  You noticed that the functions aren't quite the same: they won't produce the same result
  for some valid values of x and y. For which of the following example inputs would these two
  versions produce different outputs?

  x = 5, y = 10
  x = -8, y = 2
  x = -10, y = -3
  x = 17, y = 13
  x = 15, y = -4
