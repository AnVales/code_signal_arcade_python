You would like to write a function that takes integer numbers x, y, L and R as parameters, 
and returns True if x^y lies within the interval (L, R) and False otherwise. You're considering
several different ways to write the conditional statment inside this function.

if L > x ** y <=R :
if x ** y > L and x ** y <=R:
if x ** y in range(L + 1, R + 1):
Which option would be the most efficient in terms of execution time?

Option 1 is the most optimal one.
